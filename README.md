# Sign Language Detection and Conversion to Text and Speech

## Project Description:

The "Sign Language Detection and Conversion to Text and Speech" project aims to address communication barriers for individuals with hearing impairments. By leveraging computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and speech synthesis technologies, this comprehensive system detects and interprets sign language gestures, converts them into text, and then transforms the text into speech.

## Key Components:
### Sign Language Detection:

Precisely detects and recognizes user-made sign language motions using computer vision techniques and deep learning models.
Analyzes body language, facial expressions, and hand movements in real-time using image or video analysis.
Conversion to Text:

Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to transform sign language signals into coherent textual representations.
Converts detected movements into textual form for better understanding.

### Speech Conversion:

Employs sophisticated speech synthesis technology to convert the resulting text into speech.
Enables individuals who do not understand sign language to comprehend the intended message through spoken language.
User Interface and Integration:
User-Friendly Interface:

Facilitates easy communication for individuals with hearing loss with both sign language users and spoken language users.
Promotes inclusivity and accessibility in communication.
Adaptability:

Can be integrated into various hardware and software platforms, including PCs, tablets, and smartphones.
Ensures usability and adaptability for a wide range of users.

## Technologies Used:

* **Programming Languages**: Python
* **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Keras, TensorFlow
* **Machine Learning Tools**: Teachable Machine
* **Computer Vision Library**: OpenCV
* **Build System**: CMake
* **Version Control**: Git
* **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: PyCharm
